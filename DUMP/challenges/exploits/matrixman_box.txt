Hello tbs players, 
this is a little how-to for setting up the vmware player with knoppix like i did for this challenge. Of course this is not a must, you can use your linux box too, but this is a chance for those players, who dont want to switch to knoppix all the time.

1. Download the actual vmware player from http://www.vmware.com
   Download a knoppix distribution

2. Download a little image at http://www.minix3.org/download/minix3_1_1_small_vmware_256MB_1GB.zip and unzip it into a folder

3. You get 4 files:
dos.nvram (the BIOS)
dos.vmsd
MS-DOS.vmdk (VMware Virtual Disk File)
dos.vmx (VMware Configuration File)

4. Ajust your VMWare Configuration File (google for tuts about that or just use the one I use, maybe adjust your memsize and the path to your knoppix iso)

5. Start your Virtual machine by clicking on your Configutation File

6. Enter into the bios when it asks for it and change the boot order to boot from cdrom

7. When you get to the knoppix screen you get a prompt:
boot:
then enter "knoppix 2" without quotes to get into textmode only.
If you dont want textmode just press enter without entering anything.

8. when you are root please do the following:

echo "0" > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space

To disable the stack randomization.

Thats all!
