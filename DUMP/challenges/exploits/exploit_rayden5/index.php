Hi There,<br />
Before you start i want to give you some background information about that challenge which
might help you (or not).
You are a poor guy who signed up at some pr0n Site some time ago. Unfortunatelly since you didnt want
to spent too much money it was only a four week pass, which already expired for ages.
<br /><br />
But you are a l33t h@xx0r so you think you could try to re-activate your account on the Site. So your Goal is
simple: Reactivate your account and login to get the password for this challenge.
<br /><br />
There could also be one more Problem: You only remember your Username which was "leet_boy" but you
cant remember your password and if that would not be bad enough you also entered some fake e-mail when
you registered for the site :(
<br /><br />
One more thing: Atm the site is down for maintanence. The SiteOp reconized he messed up some directory
permissions since the site started (the usual stuff, like some files cant be created, modified or deleted, etc...).
Anyway you may run into problems that the Site dont work as expected cause of the downtime, but its your
job to find that out :)
<br /><br />
Dont expect this to be too hard. Everything you need is some knowledge, Logic and experience and once you got
it you will see it can be done in less then 5 minutes.
<br /><br />
Now Good Luck and I Hope you enjoy the
