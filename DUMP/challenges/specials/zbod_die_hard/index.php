You're just back home. Day was hard... and this headache is killing you.<br />
Something appears on your computer screen : You've recieved an email from "TerceS". Hum, who's that ?<br /><br />
<p class="challenge_1" style="text-align: center;"><br />John, our secret agency has a really important mission for you !<br />
We know that one of the most dangerous terrorist is using this site to hide some informations.<br />
Our best agent was killed just after he gave us his USB flash drive. Everything he knew about<br />
this mission is inside. Her three last words were "bomb... Christmas... midnight". The mission is<br />
to decrypt the flash drive and find the code to disarm the bomb. You have to succeed ! If not,<br />
we will have a bloody Christmas this year. You are our last chance...<br /><br /><a href="Mission.zip" style="color:#FFFFFF;">Download the flash drive</a><br /><br /></p><br />
Hum... you don't know what to think about that, and your headache doesn't help you. So maybe :<br />
- It's a joke and you are wondering who is behind TerceS and how he knows your name?<br />
- It's just spam and by clicking on the following link you'll receive a virus, trojan, ...<br />
- Everything is true and you are the only one who can stop this bomb before midnight!<br />
You check your watch, 19:44. Curiosity is stronger than you. You just put your hand on your mouse, thinking :<br />
"Come on, I've got 256 minutes to become a hero..."<br /><br />
